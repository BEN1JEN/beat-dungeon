# Beat Dungeon

Try to survive a dungeon where the monsters move to the beat.

This game was made as part of the
[First Extra Credits Game Design Jam](https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-design-jam).

## Requirements

1. Computer running Love 11.1
1. Gamepad (optional)

## Instructions

Use arrow keys or a joystick to move your character as far as possible.  Avoid
enemies (who move to the beat of your song) while your music plays.  Get as far
as possible without running out of health (hearts) before the end of your song
for a high score!  Attack your enemies by using the 'Z' and 'X' keys or the
shoulder buttons on the game pad.
